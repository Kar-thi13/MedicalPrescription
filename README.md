Addressing Patient Safety and Efficiency in Healthcare Through Technology

The risk of medication errors due to illegible handwriting in medical prescriptions. This longstanding challenge not only endangers patient safety but also disrupts pharmacy workflows and creates uncertainty for patients about their medications.

To address this, I developed an innovative OCR-NLP solution designed to accurately transcribe and validate handwritten prescriptions, minimizing the risk of errors in dispensing. The solution features a user-friendly interface that empowers patients with detailed drug information, enhancing transparency and understanding. Additionally, it incorporates robust language models to ensure accuracy, making prescriptions safer and improving the efficiency of pharmacy operations.

This patient-centric approach aims to foster safer communication between healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patientsâ€”ultimately contributing to better health outcomes and more streamlined healthcare processes.
